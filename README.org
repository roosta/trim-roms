  This removes from each system roms that doesn't have any scraped data. The
  script doesn't actually delete anything, it just moves it to a backup location
  so nothing is lost. The location is ~../roms-cleaned~ from the ~roms~ argument.


* Options
  ~-d, --dry-run~ Outputs each action to ~stdout~ but doesn't do anything
  physically. Allows for inspection of results before committing to cleaning.
